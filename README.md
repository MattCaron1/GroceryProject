Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. 
It solved the Grocer's requirements of: 
  Being able to produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
  Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
  Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.
  
What did you do particularly well?
Successfully completing each task that was required of the program to function.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Adding more comments and labels to better follow best practices.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most difficult was getting the Python and C++ to communicate with each other. Youtube videos and other walkthroughs that helped me better understand the process. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Definately using different languages and understanding each language's strengths and weaknesses so that I can better combine them in the future to make more effecient programs.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to section everything together and space out new sections. I labeled some stuff but should have added even more.
